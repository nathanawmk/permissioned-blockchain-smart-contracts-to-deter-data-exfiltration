# permissioned-blockchain-smart-contracts-to-deter-data-exfiltration
A permissioned blockchain with robust smart contract capabilities could be further extended to ensure read access to data is also consensus driven. The blockchain solution of today ensures that data that is already written to the blockchain cannot be tampered easily plus the consensus mechanism process of ensuring majority nodes agree before a data can be written to the blockchain means that write operation is secured. However, read operation (i.e., privacy) has not been addressed. In this paper, we will explore how read operation can be secured through consensus as an additional layer of protection against data exfiltration by malicious hackers.
